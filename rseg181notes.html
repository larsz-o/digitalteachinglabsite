    When to use iterative development? You should use iterative development only on projects that you want to
    succeed.<br />

    Welcome to the course! Over the next ten weeks, we are going to take a detailed look at how to successfully
    implement agile methodologies for a software development organization. We will review the basics of Agile, with a
    strong focus on Scrum, but our purpose is to understand how to actually drive change and make a transition to Agile
    successful. My goal is to arm you with tools and knowledge that I wish I had when I took on my first Agile
    transformation.
</p>
<p>
    I have had some unique experiences with Agile and we will share some interesting stories as we work through our course.
    This week we will look at the origins of Agile, why it has become so popular for software development organizations and
    what makes it so different from earlier methods.
</p>

<p>
    I got my start in the software industry during the heyday of Waterfall. Strict Waterfall is truly cumbersome. Software
    moves from one phase to the next: Requirements, then Analysis, then Design, then Coding, then Testing. My first jobs
    were writing COBOL for large mainframe environments with strict processes. Everything had to be documented with written
    approvals every step of the way. After a few big corporate jobs, I ventured out on my own and ran a software consulting
    firm for many years. I knew that I had been frustrated with the inability to deliver software in a timely manner. I knew
    that I was frustrated with the bureaucracy. What I didn’t know was that my new direction would one day have a name:
    Agile.
</p>
<p>
    As a consultant, I worked closely with my clients to design their applications. We didn’t spec everything out. Rather, I
    would meet with them and jot down their thoughts. We might draw some wireframes on a piece of paper. I would then code
    up a screen or two with fake data and zip back to the client’s office to show them what I had and get their feedback. We
    repeated this over and over until they had exactly what they needed.
</p>

<p>
    Most of the work was done by me, sometimes with the help of a few subcontractors. It was the essence of agility, but I
    know now that the way I was doing it would not have been able to scale. With larger teams working on more complex
    systems, I would have needed more disciplined approaches and that is what the Agile we know today provides.
</p>
<p>
    This week, we will explore how Agile got started. To know why agile was needed, we have to go back even further - how
    did Waterfall become the process of choice for software and why was Agile able to so thoroughly displace it?
</p>

<p>
    In the earliest days of software development, computers were weak and had very little memory. Software had to be pretty
    simple. Development was done much like I did with my consulting company. Business people would sit with a programmer and
    together they would build out what they wanted the computer to do.
</p>

<p>
    Computers grew more powerful, software needs became more complex and soon you needed a team of programmers, separate
    testers, technical writers to build documentation - more and more people. Before long it was taking a lot longer to
    build software, often what was delivered didn’t work as expected and there were tons of bugs. It became obvious that
    what we needed was project management. Where to turn? Who manages projects really well? Why, construction projects do.
    Let’s use what they use!
</p>
<p>
    The only problem was that construction projects were defined projects and software is an empirical process. You will
    learn about these terms in your materials this week. Over time, most organizations found that they were still having the
    same problems. Software still took too long to build, by the time it was finished it didn’t look much like what was
    needed and it was full of bugs.
</p>

<p>
    Development teams started looking for better ways. Kent Beck developed Extreme Programming. Ken Schwaber and Jeff
    Sutherland created Scrum. These took hold and proved that there was a better way. Finally a group got together and
    created the Agile Manifesto. Agile continued to grow and grow until now it is the accepted best practice, although with
    many variations, for software development projects.
</p>
<p>
    Your first assignment this week is to review the introduction to the Integration Paper. Nothing is due now, but you
    should gain an understanding of what is to come. The second assignment is a case study, reviewing how one company
    accomplished their Agile Transformation. Your review of the case study will help you realize some of the common
    challenges that are faced during such activities.
</p>
<p>
    Next week, we will explore some of those variations. We’ll look at some popular methodologies and where they fit. We
    will also begin work the integration paper, which will be graded at mid-term and as a final grade. At the end of the
    course your integration paper will be a handbook that you can use to implement, or just improve, Agile processes within
    your own organizations.
</p>

<p>

    As we continue through the course, there will be a variety of other assignments:
</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc outside none;  padding: 10px 10px 10px 25px;">
    <li style="margin-left:10px;">Iterative additions to the Integration paper.</li>
    <li style="margin-left:10px;">Several case studies.</li>
    <li style="margin-left:10px;">A Scrum Project Simulation.</li>
    <li style="margin-left:10px;">Review of an Agile management tool.</li>
    <li style="margin-left:10px;">Review of an Agile Enterprise Framework.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of my most rewarding experiences have come from seeing struggling projects turn around, burned-out teams become
    happy and energized. From seeing dramatic improvements in product quality and customers showing appreciation for
    delivering exactly what they wanted. I look forward to the next ten weeks of learning from each other and exploring
    Agile Software Development. I’m glad you’re here.</p>
