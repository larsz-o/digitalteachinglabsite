    <h3>Keep student code repositories organized and private with minimal setup</h3>
    <p class="inline">It's important that students who will work in software engineering gain familiarity with GitHub and other version control platforms during their professional studies. When students work in these platforms, they learn industry standard skills and they're given greater opportunities to collaborate with one another on software development projects with these tools.  This is especially  true for our students who are all online and cannot pair program in the same room together. 
    </p>
    <p class="inline">Using a git management platform for submitting homework assignments can be tricky, though. How can instructors ensure that students cannot see each others' work? GitHub Classroom solves this problem. We love this solution so much that we want to share how it works.</p>

            <h4>The workflow</h4>
               <ul>
                   <li>First, someone who is an Owner of a GitHub organization creates a new classroom. This account will be the classroom administrator.*</li>
                   <li>Next, we can connect our GitHub classroom to LATTE (otherwise known as Moodle) so that we can pull in our class roster from LATTE into our GitHub classroom.</li>
                   <li>Then, we create a new assignment.</li>
                   <li>An assignment has a title and a naming convention so that all student work will be labelled in the same way. We can also create a deadline for the assignment and include a starter or template repository for students to use.</li>
                   <li>GitHub Classroom will generate a link for us to share with students. We can copy that link and add it to LATTE.</li>
                   <li>When students click the link, they'll be asked if they want to accept the assignment. When they accept, a private** repository will be cloned for them, including their GitHub username and the naming structure we defined when setting up the assignment. The instructor will automatically be added as an admin of the repository so that they can provide feedback on the student's work.</li>
                   <li>While the repos are generated through Classroom, students work in a typical GitHub environment. For students, the only difference in using GitHub Classroom is the button that they click agreeing to accept the assignment.</li>
                   <li>Instructors can see all of the assignments that they have access to in the organization page, meaning that they don't have to track down the class's repo links from the learning management system.</li>
               </ul>
               <p class="inline">* If you don't already have an organization, you will have to create one. If you're a Graduate Professional Studies faculty member at Brandeis, you don't need to worry about this step, as we'll create the classroom space for you in our organization.</p>
               <p class="inline">** While repositories can be set to public during assginment setup, we suggest that they are configured to be private, at least while work is being completed.</p>
