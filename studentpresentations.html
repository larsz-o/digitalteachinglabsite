<h3>Just because a course is online doesn't mean presentations are out</h3>
<p class="inline">Presentations are a great way for students to connect with one another, share their ideas, and help each other learn.
    In a face-to-face course, presentations are common. Why not utilize presentations in an online course? In this demo, we'll walk through
     the process of creating, recording, and sharing
    a student presentation online. In the demo video, we show a student presenting their work on a software project that is only partially
    complete because we want to highlight how online presentations might serve as informal critique or progress check-ins, as well as more
    formal assessments of learning.

<p class="inline">The student in this demo used Zoom to schedule and record their presentation. You can use a range of tools for digital
    presentations, but we like Zoom for a few reasons. 
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Students can schedule a time for a synchronous meeting - to facilitate a good question and answer session - and record
            the meeting for those who cannot attend to watch later.
        </li>
        <li>Zoom will generate a caption file if the session is recorded and uploaded to the cloud, which is a great accessibility feature.</li>
        <li>Everyone at Brandeis has access to a Zoom account and should have familiarity with the tool. We want technology to assist learning, not overcomplicate it.</li>
    </ol>

<p class="demo-list">Now, let's take a look at the mock student presentation.</p>
<h4>Presentations change the way we learn</h4>
<p class="inline">Presentations are a great way for students to demonstrate their understanding of a concept.
    When you students are asked to create a presentation or explain a concept verbally, they are required to do more than just regurgitate
    information - they are tasked with putting it in their own words, relating it to their own knowledge base, and articulating its meaning
    to their peers.

<h4>Presenting online reduces the anxiety that many people experience with public speaking</h4>
<p class="inline">While the thought of a presentation in front of a whole in-person class might still give adult learners anxiety,
        online presentations can relieve some of those high-stress factors and allow students to practice these important skills in a lower-stakes
        environment. </p>
