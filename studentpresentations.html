<h3>Just because a course is online doesn't mean presentations are out</h3>
<p class="inline">Presentations are a great way for students to connect with one another, share their ideas, and help
    each other learn.
    In a face-to-face course, presentations are common. Why not utilize presentations in an online course? In this demo,
    we'll walk through
    the process of creating, recording, and sharing
    a student presentation online. In the demo video, we show a student presenting their work on a software project that
    is only partially
    complete because we want to highlight how online presentations might serve as informal critique or progress
    check-ins, as well as more
    formal assessments of learning.
</p>
<p class="inline">The student in this demo used Zoom to schedule and record their presentation. You can use a range of
    tools for digital
    presentations, but we like Zoom for a few reasons.
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Students can schedule a time for a synchronous meeting - to facilitate a good question and answer session -
            and record
            the meeting for those who cannot attend to watch later.
        </li>
        <li>Zoom will generate a caption file if the session is recorded and uploaded to the cloud, which is a great
            accessibility feature.</li>
        <li>Everyone at Brandeis has access to a Zoom account and should have familiarity with the tool. We want
            technology to assist learning, not overcomplicate it.</li>
    </ol>
</p>
<p class="demo-list">Now, let's take a look at the mock student presentation.</p>
<h3>Setting up a meeting</h3>
<p style="font-size: 1.1em;">The student first created a Zoom meeting and invited a classmate to join. This is one of
    the reasons why we like
    using Zoom for presentations, so that students have the option to join synchronously or asynchronously. Those who
    are able to
    join during the live session can pose questions, engage in a dialogue, and provide immediate feedback to their
    peers. Take a look at
    the following video to see how the Zoom session is set up and how the student is able to invite their classmates.
    Note: this video does not contain sound.

<p class="demo-list">Notice that the student invited their classmates using Google Calendar invites. You can also invite
    people directly
    from Zoom, but the Google Calendar will suggest people based on their name if they are a Brandeis student, staff, or
    faculty member, which makes setting up meetings for class easy.
</p>
<h3>Delivering the presentation</h3>
<p style="font-size: 1.1em;">Once the meeting is set up, the student can join the meeting at the scheduled time and
    begin the presentation.
    Watch this brief video to see the basics of a presentation. This video was recorded using Zoom, so you don't see how
    the recording began, but if you
    look at the toolbar where the student navigates to begin screen sharing, you'll see a "Record" button. Choose
    "Record to the cloud" in order to upload your video to your own Zoom account. Zoom will work on generating captions
    for the video so that it is accessible to students who need them.

<p class="demo-list">
    The student delivered a short presentation where they walked through the basics of their web app in progress. They
    were able to share
    their screen, present slides, and give an overview of the project as well as the next steps they'd like to take. If
    other students
    were in attendance, they could provide feedback on the work in progress and help this student improve the
    application. Students who
    watch the presentation later can also follow-up with the presenter through the course website's communication
    forums. This presentation
    was very low stakes. The student showed their work on a small app, presented to a small audience, and invited
    feedback. This is an excellent
    exercise for students in any course where students are working to build iterative projects. Moreover, the student
    got to practice talking
    about what various functions do and why, which helps the instructor to understand a student's comprehension level
    and is a great skill
    to build, especially in a technical field.

<h3>Why we love this assignment</h3>
<h4>Presentations change the way we learn</h4>
<p class="inline">Presentations are a great way for students to demonstrate their understanding of a concept.
    When you students are asked to create a presentation or explain a concept verbally, they are required to do more
    than just regurgitate
    information - they are tasked with putting it in their own words, relating it to their own knowledge base, and
    articulating its meaning
    to their peers.
</p>
<h4>Presenting online reduces the anxiety that many people experience with public speaking</h4>
<p class="inline">While the thought of a presentation in front of a whole in-person class might still give adult
    learners anxiety,
    online presentations can relieve some of those high-stress factors and allow students to practice these important
    skills in a lower-stakes environment. </p>
