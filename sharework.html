It's important to provide captions for any audio resources you use in the classroom, but how can you create them? In
this demo, we'll show you how to add captions to voiceover in a Google Slide presentation. This method is great for a
webinar that you plan to deliver live or record for later use, however there is one big drawback to using this method in
that the captions are not stored in any file and thus cannot be saved or accessed later unless you record your screen as
they are projected live.

    <h3>Some considerations</h3>
    <h4 style="margin-top: 2vh;">It's not perfect.</h4>
    <p>Real-time captioning is a great time-saver and a very easy way to provide access to students who need captions to
        follow along. However, because it is fast, it's not always right and it will not include punctuation.</p>
    <h4 style="margin-top: 2vh;">Captions generated in this method are not permanent, unless you record them using
        another program.</h4>
    <p>If you are using captions for a webinar or a lecture session with your course, you will need to record your
        screen in order to preserve your captions. You can use QuickTime if you are a Mac user to easily create screen
        recordings of your presentation. It's a good idea to record your screen when giving a webinar or live session
        anyway so that students who couldn't make the time slot can still participate.</p>
    <h4 style="margin-top: 2vh;">Headphones and external microphones help.</h4>
    <p>If you have an external microphone, it's a good idea to use it to ensure that your words are picked up clearly.
        Otherwise, be sure to find a quiet place to record. It can help to wear headphones so you can hone in on what
        you sound like and address any audio issues before you reach the end of your presentation.</p>
