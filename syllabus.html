<h4>Online Discussions</h4>
<p><span class="highlight">[Online discussions should be completed during the course week in which they are assigned.
        Early or late discussion posts do not earn credit. Your first post should be made by Saturday midnight of each
        course week; following posts should be made by Tuesday midnight. You are expected to post on at least three
        different days of the course week. Unless stated otherwise, you should expect to post substantive answers to
        each discussion question and at least one response to a post from two other students (3 to 4 substantive posts
        per week). A substantive post is one that is about 150-250 words, and which makes a useful point or asks a
        useful question. Posts which are poorly written, which merely quote from external sources, or which merely echo
        agreement or disagreement with another post will not earn credit. Participation beyond these minimum
        requirements will earn additional credit.]</span></p>

<h3>Course Policies and Procedures</h3>
<div class="spacer"></div>
<h4>Late Policies</h4>
<p>Assignments are due by the end of the relevant course week. For example, Homework 1 is due at the end of week 2. In
    fall 2016, this will be just after 11:59pm on Tuesday, Feb. 4. To avoid any problems caused by confusion over dates
    and times, I set assignment deadlines to be 6am on the following Wednesday. This gives you an automatic six-hour
    grace period for each assignment. If an assignment is late, it will lose 5 points for every day it is late.
    Continuing with this example, if the first assignments is submitted after 6am but before midnight on Feb. 5, it will
    lose 5 points. Submission by midnight on Feb. 6 loses 10 points. If an assignment is more than a week late, I will
    not accept it for credit. I do this so that I will have an opportunity to discuss the assignments and possibly post
    reference solutions to help the class.</p>
<p>Brandeis and its servers run on Eastern Time. If you are in another timezone, the times you see in Latte are not
    converted to your local time unless you change your preferences. Due dates and times always reflect Standard Time or
    Daylight Saving Time when these are observed in Massachusetts. Note that Brandeis will change from Eastern Daylight
    Time to Eastern Standard Time during this semester.
</p>
<div class="spacer"></div>
<h4>Grading Standards</h4>
<p>Work expectations – Students are responsible to explore each week's materials and submit required work by their due
    dates. On average, a student can expect to spend approximately 3-5 hours per week reading and approximately 5-8
    hours per week completing assignments and posting to discussions.</p>

<h4>Feedback</h4>
<p>My goal is to grade homework within a week of the due date. I will post an announcement if I am delayed in grading
    for some reason. If you submit an assignment late, I usually grade it after the following assignment is due, so that
    my feedback is timely for the greatest number of students.</p>
<p>If you have questions about assignments, the most reliable private way to reach me is via the One on One Discussion
    forum. If your question will help the entire class, I may take the liberty of answering it via the Questions and
    Answers forum.</p>
<p>If you send me a message at my Brandeis email address, I normally respond within 24 hours of receiving it. However,
    email may be delayed several days.</p>
<div class="spacer"></div>
<h4>Confidentiality</h4>
<p>We can draw on the wealth of examples from our organizations in class discussions and in our written work. However,
    it is imperative that we not share information that is confidential, privileged, or proprietary in nature. We must
    be mindful of any contracts we have agreed to with our companies. In addition, we should respect our fellow
    classmates and work under the assumption that what is discussed here (as it pertains to the workings of particular
    organizations) stays within the confines of the classroom.</p>
<p>Finally, for your awareness, members of the University's technical staff have access to all course sites to aid in
    course setup and technical troubleshooting. Program Chairs and a small number of Graduate Professional Studies (GPS)
    staff have access to all GPS courses for oversight purposes. Students enrolled in GPS courses can expect that
    individuals other than their fellow classmates and the course instructor(s) may visit their course for various
    purposes. Their intentions are to aid in technical troubleshooting and to ensure that quality course delivery
    standards are met. Strict confidentiality of student information is maintained.</p>
<div class="spacer"></div>
<h4>Time Management</h4>
<p>Students sometimes run into problems related to managing their time, especially in distance learning courses. I hope
    these ideas will help you to succeed in the class:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>If you are employed full-time, do not take more than two courses at a time. I have never yet met a student who
        could successfully manage this, especially toward the end of the term as finals and projects come due.</li>
    <li>Keep up with the course week-to-week. Don’t let yourself fall behind on readings, discussion posts, etc.
        Brandeis courses are not self-paced, and they depend on the collaboration of everyone. Participating late, or
        “trying to get ahead” is very disruptive.
    </li>
    <li>Take a look at course assignments early in the week and consider how you will approach the solutions. Ask
        questions early, so I have time to answer them. Don’t wait until Tuesday night to begin work.</li>
    <li>If you are planning a vacation, plan to continue participating in the class. Thanks to LATTE, you can post
        discussions and submit homework from virtually anywhere in the world. I will not be able to accept homework late
        because of a scheduled vacation.
    </li>
    <li>If you do find yourself short of time, remember that discussion posts count for 30% of your grade. Do not forgo
        discussions, because it’s impossible to complete the course successfully without them.</li>
    <li>If you experience a serious situation, such as a severe illness, contact me as soon as you can, or contact the
        GPS office.</li>
</ul>

<h3>University and Division of Graduate Professional Studies Standards</h3>
<p>Please review the policies and procedures of Graduate Professional Studies, found at <a
        href="http://www.brandeis.edu/gps/students/studentresources/policiesprocedures/index.html">http://www.brandeis.edu/gps/students/studentresources/policiesprocedures/index.html</a>.
    We would like to highlight the following.</p>
<div class="spacer"></div>
<h4>Accessibility and Accommodations</h4>
<p>Brandeis seeks to welcome and include all students. If you are a student who needs accommodations as outlined in an
    accommodations letter, please talk with me and present your letter of accommodation as soon as you can. I want to
    support you.</p>
<p>In order to provide test accommodations, I need the letter more than 48 hours in advance. I want to provide your
    accommodations, but cannot do so retroactively. If you have questions about documenting a disability or requesting
    accommodations, please contact Student Accessibility Support (SAS) at 781.736.3470 or access@brandeis.edu.</p>
<div class="spacer"></div>
<h4>Academic Honesty and Student Integrity</h4>
<p>Academic honesty and student integrity are of fundamental importance at Brandeis University and we want students to
    understand this clearly at the start of the term. As stated in the Brandeis Rights and Responsibilities handbook,
    “Every member of the University Community is expected to maintain the highest standards of academic honesty. A
    student shall not receive credit for work that is not the product of the student’s own effort. A student's name on
    any written exercise constitutes a statement that the work is the result of the student's own thought and study,
    stated in the student’s own words, and produced without the assistance of others, except in quotes, footnotes or
    references with appropriate acknowledgement of the source." In particular, students must be aware that material
    (including ideas, phrases, sentences, etc.) taken from the Internet and other sources MUST be appropriately cited if
    quoted, and footnoted in any written work turned in for this, or any, Brandeis class. Also, students will not be
    allowed to collaborate on work except by the specific permission of the instructor. Failure to properly cite
    resources may result in a referral being made to the Office of Student Development and Judicial Education. The
    outcome of this action may involve academic and disciplinary sanctions, which could include (but are not limited to)
    such penalties as receiving no credit for the assignment in question, receiving no credit for the related course, or
    suspension or dismissal from the University. </p>
<p>Further information regarding academic integrity may be found in the following publications: "In Pursuit of
    Excellence - A Guide to Academic Integrity for the Brandeis Community", "(Students') Rights and Responsibilities
    Handbook", AND " Graduate Professional Studies Student Handbook". You should read these publications, which all can
    be accessed from the Graduate Professional Studies Web site. A student that is in doubt about standards of academic
    honesty (regarding plagiarism, multiple submissions of written work, unacknowledged or unauthorized collaborative
    effort, false citation or false data) should consult either the course instructor or other staff of the Rabb School
    Graduate Professional Studies.</p>

<h4>University Caveat</h4>
<p>The above schedule, content, and procedures in this course are subject to change in the event of extenuating
    circumstances. If you have questions or concerns about course content before the start of the course, please contact
    the instructor. </p>
